### DISCLAIMER

This project was made solely made to showcase my knowledge in Mongo, Spring, Java,
server side development. As such the properties file is loaded with a demo user and password 
to connect to an actual DB, In actual practice that information would be loaded in a .env file
and not added to the github repo.
